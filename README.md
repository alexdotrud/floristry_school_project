## Bugs

### Solved bugs

- **Bootstrap Grid Alignment Issue:** On the Home and Gallery pages, the Bootstrap Grid system caused content within containers to be aligned more to the right. This was corrected by overriding Bootstrap's default margin and padding rules for rows and divs, setting them to 0 for proper alignment.

- **Course Cards Layout Issue:** On screen sizes 1200px and above, course cards were not displaying evenly, with two cards in one row and one in another. The issue was caused by container constraints and was resolved by adjusting grid and column settings to maintain a consistent layout across all screen sizes.

- **Broken Navigation Links on the Gallery Page:** The "Courses" and "Contact" navigation links were not functioning correctly due to missing file paths. This was fixed by adding index.html to the links, ensuring proper navigation.

### Performance Enhancements
- **Optimized Image Loading on the Gallery Page:** Converted images to WebP format for faster loading using Optimize Your Image. Compressed images to reduce file size without compromising quality using tools like TinyPNG and Image Resizer.

- **Google Fonts Optimization:** Implemented preloading and preconnect techniques to enhance font loading speed. Followed best practices from Chrome Developer Guide and ExpertBeacon to minimize render-blocking and improve page performance.
### Unfixed Bugs

- No unfixed bugs found.

### Validator Testing 

#### HTML 

On sign up page use (fieldset) element inside div with radio-buttons and checkboxes - fixed.
No other errors or warnings found.

Once the repository was set up, the GitHub Pages feature was enabled. This is done through the repository's settings.
In the repository’s settings, navigate to the "Pages" section.
Select the main branch (or the branch containing your index.html file) as the source for GitHub Pages.
Choose the root directory as the source if the index.html file is located in the main directory.
#### 3. Accessing the Live Site:
After enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub generates a URL where the project can be viewed live. This URL is shared and accessible by anyone with the link.
The live project can be accessed here: Live Project URL.
